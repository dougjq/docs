# Deployments

Trellis allows zero-downtime WordPress deployment out of the box with a little configuration. Hooks let you customize what happens at each step of the deploy process.

Trellis deploys your site from a Git repository. In your `wordpress_sites.yml` file, found in the `group_vars/<environment>` directory, make sure the `repo` and `branch` keys are set correctly:

- `repo` - Git URL of your Bedrock-based WordPress project (in SSH format: `git@github.com:org/repo-name.git`)
- `branch` - Git branch to deploy (default: `master`)

```diff
wordpress_sites:
  example.com:
    ...
-   repo: git@github.com:example/example.com.git
+   repo: git@github.com:org/repo-name.git
-   branch: master
+   branch: main
```

## Deploying

Run the following from any directory within your project:

```shell
trellis deploy <environment>
```

::: warning Note
**Trellis does not automatically "install" WordPress on remote servers**.

It's normal and expected to see the WordPress install screen the first time you deploy. It's up to you to either import an existing database or install a fresh site.

::: warning Note
**About zero-downtime deploys**.

Each deploy, Trellis makes a new folder. The "deploy" is effected by symlinking, see below Hooks. This is also how rollbacks work. Database migrations to a new schema are not included as part of a Trellis deploy. This means that if you need to migrate your database (for example, to account for new plugins), you may need to expect downtime depending on how you manage your database. Modify your deploy process to account for database migrations as with any other framework.

## Rollbacks

Run the following from any directory within your project:

```shell
trellis rollback <environment>
```

Manually specify a different release using `--release=12345678901234` as such:

```shell
trellis rollback --release=12345678901234 <environment>
```

By default Trellis stores five previous releases, not including the current release. See `deploy_keep_releases` in [Options - Remote Servers](wordpress-sites.md) to change this setting.

## Hooks

Trellis deploys let you customize what happens at each step of the atomic deployment process. A single deploy has the following steps in order:

1. `initialize` - creates the site directory structure (or ensures it exists)
2. `update` - clones the Git repo onto the remote server
3. `prepare` - prepares the files/directories in the new release path (such as moving the repo subtree if one exists)
4. `build` - builds the new release by copying templates, files, and folders
5. `share` - symlinks shared files/folders to new release
6. `finalize` - finalizes the deploy by updating the `current` symlink (atomic deployments)

Each step has a `before` and `after` hook. The hooks are variables that you can define with a list of custom task files to be included and run when the hook fires.

The hook variables available are:

- `deploy_before`
- `deploy_initialize_before`
- `deploy_initialize_after`
- `deploy_update_before`
- `deploy_update_after`
- `deploy_prepare_before`
- `deploy_prepare_after`
- `deploy_build_before`
- `deploy_build_after`
- `deploy_share_before`
- `deploy_share_after`
- `deploy_finalize_before`
- `deploy_finalize_after`
- `deploy_after`

### Default hooks

By default, Trellis defines and uses three hooks:

- `deploy_build_after` runs `composer install`.
- `deploy_finalize_before` checks the WordPress installation.
- `deploy_finalize_after` refreshes WordPress settings and reloads php-fpm.

The default deploy hooks are defined in `roles/deploy/defaults/main.yml`:

```yaml
deploy_build_before:
  - '{{ playbook_dir }}/deploy-hooks/build-before.yml'

deploy_build_after:
  - '{{ playbook_dir }}/roles/deploy/hooks/build-after.yml'
  # - "{{ playbook_dir }}/deploy-hooks/sites/{{ site }}-build-after.yml"

deploy_finalize_before:
  - '{{ playbook_dir }}/roles/deploy/hooks/finalize-before.yml'

deploy_finalize_after:
  - '{{ playbook_dir }}/roles/deploy/hooks/finalize-after.yml'
```

The `deploy_build_before` definition and the commented path under `deploy_build_after` offer examples of using hooks for custom tasks, as described below.

### Custom tasks

To use a deploy hook, define or override the hook variable somewhere within your `group_vars` directory, such as in `group_vars/all/main.yml`. If you end up defining many hooks, you may want to create a new file such as `group_vars/all/deploy-hooks.yml`.

Each deploy hook variable is a list of task files to be included and run when the hook fires. We suggest keeping your hooked task files in a top level `deploy-hooks` folder. Here are some example hook variable definitions:

```yaml
# Defining a hook that Trellis does not already use by default
deploy_before:
  - '{{ playbook_dir }}/deploy-hooks/deploy-before.yml'

# Overriding a hook that Trellis already uses by default
deploy_build_after:
  - '{{ playbook_dir }}/roles/deploy/hooks/build-after.yml'
  - '{{ playbook_dir }}/deploy-hooks/build-after.yml'
  - '{{ playbook_dir }}/deploy-hooks/sites/{{ site }}-build-after.yml'
```

The second example above demonstrates overriding the `deploy_build_after` hook that Trellis already uses by default. The first include file in this hook's list is `roles/deploy/hooks/build-after.yml`, which is the task file Trellis usually executes. If you omit a hook's default file when overriding an existing hook variable, the default file's tasks will no longer execute.

The second include file in the `deploy_build_after` example above, `deploy-hooks/build-after.yml`, is an example of adding a custom task file that would run on every deploy, regardless the site being deployed. The third include file, <code>deploy-hooks/sites/{{ site }}-build-after.yml</code>, demonstrates how you could use a `{{ site }}` variable to include a file based on the name of the site being deployed, e.g., `example.com-build-after.yml`.
